## About

MultiColour Blender GCode Importer is an enhancement to kmnunleys  plug-in that translates printer GCode into Bezier curve paths in Blender, and creates a simulated multicolour timelapse of the print.

## Installation
To install the plugin, download the repository. Then go to Preferences > Addons and click the Install button. Find the multicolour_gcode_importer.py file from the repository and click install.

## Usage
To import a GCode file to Blender, simply go to File > Import and select the Multicolour GCode option. In the new file browser window, find and select the .gcode file you would ike to import, then click 'Import Gcode'

The importer also creates simulated head movement that can be tied to an animation of a real printer - see youtube demo for an example.
The importer also has the ability to add time values to the key frames - so that for example a clock can be animated alongside the timelapse.
